# Overview

A Custom Civicrm extension that upon enabling will create a custom field called "Reciept ID" for contributions.

When a new contribution is made, Reciept ID will be filled with a unique ID, based on whether the Financial Type chosen is deductable or not.

If it's tax deductable, it starts with "TDR", if not it starts with "NTDR", the number that follows is an auto-increment that is seperate from the other deductable type 

(Example: if there's an NTDR12, the new Contribution id will be NTDR13, the auto increment will not be affected by reciept id's starting with TDR)
